# Django Autocomplete Search
This is a small project that serves as a demo implementation of a simple Django autocomplete search solution.

Please refer to the [associated blog post here](https://www.chuckvallone.com/posts/a-simple-django-autocomplete-search-solution-for-low-complexity-search-requirements) for more information.


# Autocomplete Solution
The autocomplete search solution used here is simple and meant for low-complexity search requirements. Why go through the hassle of implementing and managing a dedicated search service or library if it really isn't necessary.


# Getting Started
If you want to run the project locally, clone it and then go through the following steps:

1) Create a virtual env and activate it:
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

2) Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3) Fire up Django
```
python manage.py runserver
```
